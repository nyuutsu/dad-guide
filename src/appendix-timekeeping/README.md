# Appendix B: Time Keeping

Time can be recorded to either a Service Request or a Project. DAD is developed so that all daily activities are recorded in DAD daily so that an electronic timesheet can be formulated that directly ties the funding source billable amounts to specific advocacy efforts for audit purposes.

DAD supports tracking time spent working on specific Client Service Requests and Projects.
