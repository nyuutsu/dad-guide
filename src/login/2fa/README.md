# Background

## Context

When you sign into an online account, you typically show them who you are (and therefore what information to show you) by telling them two pieces of information: your username and password for that service. This approach works well enough for some purposes, but has limitations: usernames are easy to discover. Passwords are hard to remember, so people tend to use simple ones and then also re-use them across sites and services. Passwords are useful, but they can be compromised or guessed.

This is why higher-security online accounts (e.g. banks, retirement accounts, online pay statements) often include* additional* checks when trying to sign in, such as "texting or emailing you a code and then asking you to provide that code". What they are doing is having you provide a second "factor", or "thing that proves who you are". That service "uses two-factor authentication" (2FA).

## DAD & 2FA

[DAD](https://dad.ndrn.org/) has been updated to use two-factor authentication. The first factor isn't new: it's your password. The second factor is a short-duration security code generated by an app called an "authenticator". This is a guide on **how to get your authenticator set up and what logging in will look like once you have it.**

Setup is about installing an authenticator and telling it how to produce codes for you. You only have to do the steps in setup once.
