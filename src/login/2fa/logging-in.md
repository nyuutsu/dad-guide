# How does logging in using 2FA work once I have set it up?



## Logging in

Log in to DAD using your username and password.

Most of the time, you will be logged in immediately, in the manner you are used to.

Some of the time, you will be asked to give a code from your authenticator. So, open your authenticator, and find the correct entry. It will show you a unique, dynamically generated six-digit number. You enter this code into the verification code field in DAD and you're in!

## "Remember this device?"

The first time you log in using 2fa, you won't be given any additional options.

From the second time onwards, whenever you log in to DAD and are asked to give an authenticator code, you will *also* be shown a checkbox, asking "remember this device?". It will look something like this:

- [ ] Remember this device?

**If you check the box (answering "yes"), then for the next 45 days, DAD will continue to let you log in on that device without asking you for a code again.**

So: if checked, you will have authenticate every 1.5 months or whenever you use DAD from a new computer; whichever happens first.

```admonish tip
If you wanted to check "remember this device" and didn't: don't worry! You can just do it next time. Each time you try to log in to DAD and DAD asks you to provide a code, it will also ask if you would this time like to "remember this device". Just check the box that time and you'll be all set to not have to provide a code for a while.
```

```admonish bug "Advanced Tip"
The remember this device option is only able to remember one account at a time: the most recently "remembered" one. As result when you switch to a second account you will likely be prompted for a 2fa code even if you had previously checked remember this device for it.
