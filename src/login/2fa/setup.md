# How do I set it up?

Decide whether you will be using your phone or your browser as your authenticator.

```admonish info
NDRN recommends using a phone, but either will work.
```

Follow the corresponding section's steps: Phone Authentication Setup if using a phone or Browser Authentication Setup if using a browser.

The details vary, but the process each of the sections will have you do is the same:

1. Install an authenticator.

    * Skip this step if you already have an authenticator.

2. Attempt to log in to DAD using your username and password. DAD will present you with a QR code.

3. Use your authenticator to scan the QR code in DAD, creating a DAD authenticator entry

4. Enter a code from your new DAD authenticator entry into DAD to confirm that setup worked

```admonish
If you already have an authenticator on your phone, you should use that rather than installing another one. To do so: open the section on Phone Authentication Setup and in it skip ahead to the subsection Use the authenticator to scan the QR code 
```
