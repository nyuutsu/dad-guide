# How do I set it up?

You'll need to pick a device to be your authenticator. You can use a smartphone or you can use any modern web browser on your computer. Decide whether you will be using your phone or your browser as your authenticator.

```admonish note "Suggestion"
NDRN recommends using a phone, but either will work.
```

Follow the corresponding section's steps: [Phone Authentication Setup](phone.md) if using a phone or [Browser Authentication Setup](browser.md) if using a browser.

The details vary, but the process each of the sections will have you follow is the same:

1. Install an authenticator (if you don't already have one).

2. Attempt to log in to DAD using your username and password. DAD will present you with a QR code and a CHALLENGE PHRASE.

3. In your authenticator, scan the QR code or enter the CHALLENGE PHRASE. This creates a DAD authenticator entry

4. Enter a code from your new DAD authenticator entry into DAD to confirm that setup worked

```admonish info "Clarification"
Much like a password, the codes your authenticator will make will work on any of your devices.
```

```admonish tip "Advanced Tip"
If you want, you can set up DAD authenticator entries on as many devices as you want.
```
