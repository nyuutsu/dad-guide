# Multiple Accounts Information

## The Remember this device checkbox

The remember this device option is only able to remember one account at a time: the most recently "remembered" one. As result when you switch to a second account you will likely be prompted for a 2fa code even if you had previously checked remember this device for it.

```admonish
The last step of setting up the authenticator, Enter a code from your new DAD authenticator entry into DAD to confirm that setup worked, doesn't know how to ask you if you want to remember this device. So the first opportunity you'll have to remember this device is going to be the next time you log in after that.
```

## Authenticator Entries Explained

```admonish
An earlier revison of this guide had an unclear instruction in it that led to some people scanning and trying to use my QR code rather than their own. Sorry! If you find that you're trying to use my (or some third party's) authenticator entry rather than your own: see the Support section's The codes my authenticator is making don't work heading.
