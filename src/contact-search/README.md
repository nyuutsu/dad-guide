# Basic Contact Search Criteria

Whenever contact is made with a new individual or potential client the first step is to do a search to determine the individual has ever been entered in the system as a client, guardian, contact or advisory of a client, or in anyway has been previously connected to the agency. This step avoids entering an individual into the system more than once.

DAD doesn't have the ability to check for potential conflicts of interest as part of its toolset.

```admonish note
The same search logic exists for projects and service requests.
```

**Advanced Contact Search** can be accessed by your DAD Desktop dropdown menu and has many more options for search criteria.

```admonish note
If DAD contains contact records that match your search information, they will be displayed on a Search Results screen. From that screen, you can choose to view one of the listed contact records.  If the contact found matches your Client information, a new Service Request can then be created for the existing Client.  If the contact search did not find a match in the existing data base, you will need to create a new Client.
```

```admonish tip
Both methods include a "Sounds Like" and "Match on" feature in case you are not sure how some of the search items are spelled. It is recommended that two (2) searches are done with one using the 'Sounds Like' feature to avoid 'duplications' when entering new Clients and Service Requests.
