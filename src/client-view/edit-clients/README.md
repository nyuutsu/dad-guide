# Edit Clients

To edit a Client, you must start from the Client Detail or Client Summary view. You get there by choosing a Client from your Desktop, or searching for and selecting a Client.

From the Client view, you can choose to edit almost any section of the Client. See the Client View section of this User’s Guide for details.
