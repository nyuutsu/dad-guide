# Edit Clients

To edit a Client, you must start from the Client Detail or Client Summary view. You get there by choosing a Client from your Desktop, or searching for and selecting a Client.

From the Client view, you can choose to edit almost any section of the Client. See the [Client View](http://https://dadbooktest.nyuu.page/client-view/index.html) section of this User’s Guide for details.

You can edit the Client’s legal guardian, primary, or other Contact from the Client view or from the Actions drop down menu. From the Client view, scroll down to the Contacts section, or select Display Client Contacts from the Actions/Views drop down menu. Once the Contact list is displayed, you can select View Details, Edit or Delete for any Contact. To add a new Contact, choose Create New Client Contact from the Tasks in the drop down menu from the Client Contacts screen.
