# Client View

The Client View displays information about a specific client; a list of your choice of all, open, or closed Service Requests for that client; and contacts for that Client. You can also see your choice of all, or the last five, the last 10, or the last 15 notes written about that Client.

You can access the Client View three ways:  

1. By choosing a specific Client record from the list on your Desktop. 

2. By left clicking the Client link from any DAD window (for the last client you viewed). Be sure you are in correct Client before you add or edit any information. 

3. By choosing a Basic or Advanced Contact Search to find a Client from the Desktop Actions Tasks dropdown. 

*NOTE: You have the option to choose to have the Contact search function on the Desktop under User Preferences.*

You have the following options in the “Actions” drop-down menu when in the Client view.
