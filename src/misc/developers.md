# For Developers

*This section isn't part of the DAD guide! This section is about how to make this website! If you're here to learn about using DAD: you can skip this page and you won't have missed anything.*

This demo is based mostly on Zach's PDF, "DAD Manual 2018", that gets circulated around the network. It has a footer stating it is "Version 2.2 - 2018" in some parts a a footer stating it is from "November 2017" in others. I'll synthesize new information and what I've learned from teaching about the system.

I (Milo) would *strongly* recommend that if you see this site and go "that's cool: I want one for myself or my organization": read out and we'll talk about feasability. As nice as the workflow is for *me*: most people would probably get a lot more out of just getting wordpress or similar.
```

If you would like to have a go at it regardless: [the project source may be found here & I've also provided some instructions](https://github.com/nyuutsu/dad-guide)
