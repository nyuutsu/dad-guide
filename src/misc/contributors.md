This demo is based mostly on a PDF titled "DAD Manual 2018 - Copy (2).pdf" that gets circulated around the network. It has a footer stating it is "Version 2.2 - 2018" in some parts a a footer stating it is from "November 2017" in others. My *guess* is that this was written by Mike, but, I'm not totally sure. I'll synthesize new information and what I've learned from teaching about the system, in a final version of this e-guide, if I'm told to keep working on this.

The software used is "[mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)". The software takes user input in the form of plain text files and interprets them to generate a website in an ebook/e-manual style.

The demo of the software output is hosted on a subdomain on Milo's personal server: [https://dadbooktest.nyuu.page](https://dadbooktest.nyuu.page).
