# Projects

Projects are used to document efforts such as monitoring facilities, education and outreach activities, systems advocacy, and investigations involving a group of people. Projects can also be used to document administrative activities and time.

Service Requests can have only one Funding Source and one Priority and Objective to record the agencyâ€™s advocacy efforts. If the agency needs to use multiple funding sources to document one advocacy effort, multiple Service Requests must be created to 
accommodate for each funding source.

Projects can have multiple Priority and Objectives and multiple Funding Sources. If multiple Funding Sources are selected the Funding Source distribution in percent must total 100%.
