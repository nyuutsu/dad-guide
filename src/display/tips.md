# Display/User Preferences Tips

* Mouse acceleration feature is ***Off*** by default. For **Assistive Technology Devices**, this feature must be turned ***On***. When turned on, actions from your DAD Action drop-down menus launch with just the click of a mouse. 

* If you do not choose a Desktop Control item to be displayed on your Desktop, you will still be able to display it manually by choosing the item from the Desktop Actions drop-down menu.  The **Action** drop-down menu **display** options are categorized by **Primary**, **Associated**, **Team** and **Agency**.  The assignment category is specified from each Client, Service Request and Project.

* You must **refresh** DAD before you can see any User Preference changes you have made.  To refresh, go to the DAD desktop, right click your mouse and select **Refresh**.
