# Hi, Zach!

This is a demonstration of a potential format for a DAD user manual. It's sort of like a "wiki" and sort of like an "ebook". I've prepared the table of contents (but most of it is dummied/blanked out since I haven't migrated the **content** yet). I also prepared the first two pages / sections of the guide, "Background" and "Logging into DAD", so you can get a feel for what it is I'm proposing doing. Try it out!

# Sales pitch for "have me finish porting the DAD guide over to this online format":

* It is easy to develop / modify the guide contents

* **if we make people use a website, we can make changes to the guide and they will see those changes since they're looking at a website and not some pdf they downloaded in 2019**

* It is easy to "deploy" the guide to the internet and to push changes / updates

* There is a default "theme" (this black/purple background, white text, font & font size, placement of the table of contents on the left sidebar, etc); any part of this can be changed in accordance with our needs.

* The software is open-source and is entirely free. It's also pretty lightweight. NDRN already owns web addresses and server space, so, hosting this thing should be approximately free. I can write a guide (it will be short; this is a very simple tool) on what it is that I "did", so that whoever comes after me can maintain it independently.

I'm not entirely sure what the NDRN web development accessibility requirements are but I forsee it being practical to meet any needs that come up
