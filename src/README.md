# TEMPORARY LANDING PAGE!? CHANGELOG!?!?

Creating the ***ULTIMATE D.A.D. MANUAL*** is going to require a few passes of document revisions.

* **☑** ~~1-2 page "confirm I should bother working on this" test~~

* **☑** ~~create site doc structure based on pdf table of contents~~

* **☐** import + newline/hard-wordwrap remove + table-ify pdf contents¹ **← we are here!**

* **☐** correct image sequencing / section placement

* **☐** rewrite / reorganize text

* **☐** add 2fa + workflows + admin sections


¹ I made a point to be *selective* about what I change during this "get everything *out of the pdf*" pass. many of the images are in the wrong location. this is because they're wrong in the pdf and I'm just replicating the pdf structure here.
