# Background

The Disability Advocacy Database ([DAD](https://dad.ndrn.org/)) is a web-based data collection and management system developed by the Protection and Advocacy Network specifically
for P&A/CAP programs. What started as a unified way to collect Program Performance Report (PPR) data has now evolved into an office wide tool that combines HR features
such as time sheet management, and cost allocation tools for administrative and non-client specific advocacy efforts. DAD has also stayed true to its intent for creation of
assisting P&A/CAP programs with completing PPRs for federal grants and contracts and the templates in place now allow agencies to have responses to data requests at their fingertips. DAD is shared system based on a cost sharing model.

NDRN has a DAD Committee that is made up representatives from across those agencies to serve as an advisory panel for all changes and assist with support of the system.

NDRN has recently renewed its investment into the infrastructure of the DAD IT Services with offsite live mirroring and additional backup power solutions to support whatever natural or other disaster that may head to the DC area to keep your data available.

Subscribing to the DAD system gives agency management peace of mind that: changes to federal forms, changes to guidelines for electronic storage of client data, and/or
revisions to accessibility guidelines for web pages will not have an impact on the direct or indirect client services your agency provides. NDRN maintains those standards for
the DAD system and implements changes as needed which are included with your subscription.

Any agency interested in viewing a demo of the DAD system in its entirety (or just to view the HR features such as the time keeping aspect) should schedule a web-based presentation with Zach Martin \([zachary.martin@ndrn.org](MAILTO:zachary.martin@ndrn.org)\).
