* Password is case sensitive
* Please ***DO NOT*** allow your computer to remember your password for security reasons
* Passwords can be changed at any time as needed. If your password security is compromised, stolen, etc. contact your DAD Administrator.

select “Change Password” to create your own personal password. If you forget your
person password you administrator has the ability to issue you a temporary password.
