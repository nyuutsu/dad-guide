# How does logging in using 2FA work once I have set it up?

## Logging in

Log in to DAD using your username and password.

You may be asked to provide a code from your second factor (your authenticator!) to verify your identity. If you are: you will open the authenticator app. It will show you a unique, dynamically generated six-digit number. You enter this code into the verification code field in DAD and you're in!
"Remember this device?"

You will also be asked if you would like to "remember this device". **If you check the box (answering "yes"), then for the next roughly-one-month, DAD will continue to let you log in on that device without asking you for a code again.** So: you will have authenticate about about once per month or whenever you use DAD from a new computer; whichever happens first.

If you wanted to check "remember this device" and didn't: don't worry! You can just do it next time. Each time you try to log in to DAD and DAD asks you to provide a code, it will also ask if you would this time like to "remember this device". Just check the box that time and you'll be all set to not have to provide a code for a while.

There are a few details about how "remember this device" works that this section doesn't cover and that are going to be of particular interest to users with multiple accounts. See the Multiple Accounts Information section for details.
